-   It's cross platform
-   Works with all operating systems

## Popular in academia \~ Trending

-   Programming language but
    -   natural language alike
    -   functions- named, verbs
    -   easy to guess and remember
-   Non-computer science people can learn
-   Documentation is vast

## Reproducible research workflow

-   Data wrangling
-   Analysis scripts
-   Report generation- publication ready tables and graphs
-   Code sharing
-   Version control
-   Reproducible by anyone

## Elegant visualizations or graphs

## Rich library / packages

-   CRAN \~ Comprehensive R Archive Network
-   Currently 18693 packages
-   Range of topics
    -   basic epidemiology to causal inference
    -   pharmacokinetics to genomics
    -   descriptive analysis to multi-variable
    -   reporting templates etc

## Non-statistical uses

-   Since R is a programming language
-   Develop websites
-   Web Apps
-   Dashboards
-   Report and presentation
-   Programming
